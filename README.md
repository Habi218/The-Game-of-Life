# The Game of Life

## Introduction

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton simulation that explores the patterns that can arise from a few rules. The game and its rules were created by mathematician John Conway in 1970. The simulation consists of a grid of cells that can be in either a dead or alive state. The next state of each cell is determined by the number of alive and dead neighbors it has. While it is not typically considered a conventional game, this project aims to implement the cellular generation of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life and introduce a puzzle exploration aspect to it. In this iteration the player is encouraged to explore the evolution of each initial pattern they create.

## Game Design

### Game Manager

The game uses the singleton pattern by creating a game manager instance that has a game state property. The manager is responsible for managing scene transitions and retaining data that needs to be persistent from scene to scene. The game has four scenes, a main menu, a rules scene, a game settings menu, and a game board scene.

### Game States

- Main Menu: The initial state of the game on launch. It provides players with a choice to either start a game, go to the game settings menu, the rules page, or exit the game.
- Rules: Shows a description of how the game is played and what the controls of the game are.
- Game Settings: A menu where players can change the dimensions of the game board.
- Setup: The first state of a play session where players set up the pattern of live cells they want to see evolve. Players can left click on any cell to turn it into a live cell or right click to turn it to a dead cell. They are given a max of 20 cells to place and must place at least 3. They can press R to reset the board and Spacebar to enter the play state.
- Play: The simulation evolves over time and the player can press E to increase the simulation speed or Q to decrease the simulation speed. The player can press Spacebar to enter the pause state.
- Paused: The evolution of the simulation is stopped and the player can press Spacebar again to enter the play state again.
- Victory: When the player reaches the 50th generation or achieves a population of 50 live cells on the board the player wins and is prompted to either continue the simulation or reset the board and go back to the setup state.
- Game Over: When the population is reduced to zero, the game enters the game over state and players are prompted to return to the setup state.

### Cell Management

- The game board consists of a two dimensional grid
- Each cell has two possible state: dead or alive
- The state of a cell is determined by states of its eight neighbors
- If a cell is alive and has two or three live neighbors it lives in the next generation otherwise it dies
- If a cell is dead and has exactly three live neighbors it becomes a live cell in the next generation
